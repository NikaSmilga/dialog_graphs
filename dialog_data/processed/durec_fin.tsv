9882	789: [1] nan_1 [2] other_1	2	other_1	speaker_2	let me give you a little advice.
9883	789: [1] nan_1 [2] other_1	3	other_1	speaker_2	You know what the topics are going to be, so prepares what you would like to say in advance.
9884	789: [1] nan_1 [2] other_1	4	other_1	speaker_1	I often do, but I’m worried about the responses from other people.
9885	789: [1] nan_1 [2] other_1	5	other_1	speaker_2	you have to be realistic.
9886	789: [1] nan_1 [2] other_1	6	other_1	speaker_2	Not everyone is going to agree with you, but people will respect your opinion and they will respect the fact that you have contributed something to the discussion.
9887	789: [1] nan_1 [2] other_1	7	other_1	speaker_1	I’m worried that what I say will not make sense.
9888	789: [1] nan_1 [2] other_1	8	other_1	speaker_2	we could chat about the topic before class.
9889	789: [1] nan_1 [2] other_1	9	other_1	speaker_2	I could check that what you want to say is logical and it would also give you a chance to practice speaking.
9890	789: [1] nan_1 [2] other_1	10	other_1	speaker_1	that’s a good idea.
9891	789: [1] nan_1 [2] other_1	11	other_1	speaker_1	What should I do if I am in two minds about a topic?
9892	789: [1] nan_1 [2] other_1	12	other_1	speaker_2	that’s easy.
9893	789: [1] nan_1 [2] other_1	13	other_1	speaker_2	Express possibilities.
9894	789: [1] nan_1 [2] other_1	14	other_1	speaker_2	People will think that you are pretty smart to be able to look at the topic from more than one angle.
9895	789: [1] nan_1 [2] other_1	15	other_1	speaker_1	I didn’t realize that speaking in class could be so easy.
9896	789: [1] nan_1 [2] other_1	16	other_1	speaker_2	the most difficult thing is being able to predict what other people will say.
9897	789: [1] nan_1 [2] other_1	17	other_1	speaker_2	They will reply to your statements, but you can’t be sure how.

10475	833: [1] chitchat about other_1	6	chitchat about other_1	speaker_2	Now, I know the answer.
10476	833: [1] chitchat about other_1	7	chitchat about other_1	speaker_1	You know, in a sense, a suits and ties are compulsory for male employees even in July, and no jewelry allowed for most of the female employees.
10477	833: [1] chitchat about other_1	8	chitchat about other_1	speaker_1	Even the reasonable male leaf is returning the rule, isn’t that strict?

10479	833: [1] chitchat about other_1	10	chitchat about other_1	speaker_2	Anyway, whether they like it or not, they do give people a very good impression.
10480	833: [1] chitchat about other_1	11	chitchat about other_1	speaker_1	But it is unjust to judge a book by its cover.
10481	833: [1] chitchat about other_1	12	chitchat about other_1	speaker_1	If they’re not happy or comfortable with their clothes, they can be less productive.

10487	834: [1] Q&A about other_1	5	Q&A about other_1	speaker_1	I thought he had a great chance of winning a gold medal!
10488	834: [1] Q&A about other_1	6	Q&A about other_1	speaker_2	If he didn't have any drug problems, he would have won.
10489	834: [1] Q&A about other_1	7	Q&A about other_1	speaker_1	What?
10490	834: [1] Q&A about other_1	8	Q&A about other_1	speaker_1	What kind of drugs was he using?
10491	834: [1] Q&A about other_1	9	Q&A about other_1	speaker_2	He was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster.
10492	834: [1] Q&A about other_1	10	Q&A about other_1	speaker_1	I thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs.
10493	834: [1] Q&A about other_1	11	Q&A about other_1	speaker_2	They are.
10494	834: [1] Q&A about other_1	12	Q&A about other_1	speaker_2	The only reason they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards.
10495	834: [1] Q&A about other_1	13	Q&A about other_1	speaker_1	That's so disappointing.
10496	834: [1] Q&A about other_1	14	Q&A about other_1	speaker_1	I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs.
10497	834: [1] Q&A about other_1	15	Q&A about other_1	speaker_2	I don't think it's right, but I can understand why they might.
10498	834: [1] Q&A about other_1	16	Q&A about other_1	speaker_2	Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country!
10499	834: [1] Q&A about other_1	17	Q&A about other_1	speaker_1	Regardless of how much pressure you're under, there's never a good reason to take drugs.
10500	834: [1] Q&A about other_1	18	Q&A about other_1	speaker_2	I agree.
10501	834: [1] Q&A about other_1	19	Q&A about other_1	speaker_2	Hopefully with the new regulations, fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs.

11212	893: [1] greeting_1 [2] chitchat about other_1 [3] movie recommendation_1	10	chitchat about other_1	speaker_2	But if I were you, I wouldn't have the courage to watch the first one.
11213	893: [1] greeting_1 [2] chitchat about other_1 [3] movie recommendation_1	11	chitchat about other_1	speaker_1	But it's really exciting.
11214	893: [1] greeting_1 [2] chitchat about other_1 [3] movie recommendation_1	12	chitchat about other_1	speaker_2	Maybe, but I would rather watch romance, science fiction, crime or even disaster movie instead of a horror picture.
11215	893: [1] greeting_1 [2] chitchat about other_1 [3] movie recommendation_1	13	chitchat about other_1	speaker_2	I wouldn't dare sleep at night after watching one.
11216	893: [1] greeting_1 [2] chitchat about other_1 [3] movie recommendation_1	14	chitchat about other_1	speaker_1	Basically.
11217	893: [1] greeting_1 [2] chitchat about other_1 [3] movie recommendation_1	15	chitchat about other_1	speaker_1	you'll watch any type of movie except horror.
11218	893: [1] greeting_1 [2] chitchat about other_1 [3] movie recommendation_1	16	chitchat about other_1	speaker_2	Yep.
11219	893: [1] greeting_1 [2] chitchat about other_1 [3] movie recommendation_1	17	movie recommendation_1	speaker_1	I think you should have a try someday.

11221	893: [1] greeting_1 [2] chitchat about other_1 [3] movie recommendation_1	19	movie recommendation_1	speaker_2	Maybe.
11222	893: [1] greeting_1 [2] chitchat about other_1 [3] movie recommendation_1	20	movie recommendation_1	speaker_2	After all, I am grown up now.
11223	894: [1] chitchat about economy_1	0	chitchat about economy_1	speaker_1	It's hard to be optimistic about things with the way the economy's headed... The trade deficit is getting larger, consumption's down, I really think we're headed for a recession.
11224	894: [1] chitchat about economy_1	1	chitchat about economy_1	speaker_2	The economy has been stagnant for a while now.
11225	894: [1] chitchat about economy_1	2	chitchat about economy_1	speaker_2	We've been in a recessive state for several months already.
11226	894: [1] chitchat about economy_1	3	chitchat about economy_1	speaker_2	What worries me the most is the trade deficit.
11227	894: [1] chitchat about economy_1	4	chitchat about economy_1	speaker_2	I think the government should do more to encourage exports.
11228	894: [1] chitchat about economy_1	5	chitchat about economy_1	speaker_1	Increasing exports would weaken the currency.
11229	894: [1] chitchat about economy_1	6	chitchat about economy_1	speaker_1	I think the main point is economic growth.
11230	894: [1] chitchat about economy_1	7	chitchat about economy_1	speaker_1	We need more jobs.
11231	894: [1] chitchat about economy_1	8	chitchat about economy_1	speaker_1	Factories have outsourced and moved many jobs to foreign countries.
11232	894: [1] chitchat about economy_1	9	chitchat about economy_1	speaker_1	The result is an increase in unemployment in our own country, lower consumption, lower production, and an overall feeble economy.
11233	894: [1] chitchat about economy_1	10	chitchat about economy_1	speaker_1	If more people are working, it will give the economy a boost.
11234	894: [1] chitchat about economy_1	11	chitchat about economy_1	speaker_2	It's true that we should do something about unemployment, but what about inflation?
11235	894: [1] chitchat about economy_1	12	chitchat about economy_1	speaker_2	If unemployment falls, there's pressure to increase pay.
11236	894: [1] chitchat about economy_1	13	chitchat about economy_1	speaker_2	That would result in inflation, which would result in a much less dynamic economy.
