You need to annotate a dialog with speakers' goals. Here is a list of goals that a user may pursue: greeting, Q&A about X, chitchat about X, ask about X, X recommendation, weather notification, and saying goodbye. X stands for an entity type, for example animals, music, movie, food, art, games, gossip, science, sport, travel, weather. All the other goals should be marked as other or Q&A about other or chitchat about other, ask about other, other recommendation.
Also annotate the state of the goal according to the instruction:
GOAL_DETECTED: the goal is first detected 
GOAL_IN_PROGRESS: corresponds to all utterances that happen between the goal detection and the goal completion
GOAL_ACHIEVED: corresponds to the last user utterance that indicates achieving the goal
GOAL_NOT_ACHIEVED: corresponds to the situation when the goal was in process of completion (GOAL_IN_PROGRESS) in the previous utterances, but for some reason the goal is not achieved in the end

Example of an annotated dialog:  
speaker_1: Hello! What would you like to do? | goals: greeting, ask about other
